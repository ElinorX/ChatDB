Query Syntax Guide
----------------
SQL Specific:
1. Price Queries:

2. Price Combinations:
   - Can combine price with ratings and comments
   - Can use price sorting with any condition
   - Can use price ranges with discounts

NoSQL Specific:
1. Rating Queries:
   - with rating greater than X
   - with comments greater than X

2. Category Analysis:
   - group by category
   - Can combine with ratings and comments

Join Query Syntax Guide
---------------------
1. Two-Table Join Keywords:
   - related to (INNER JOIN)
   - matching (INNER JOIN)
   - combined with (INNER JOIN)
   - including (LEFT JOIN)
   - along with (LEFT JOIN)

   - Appliances <-> Car and Motorbike Products (main_category)
   - Air Conditioners <-> Car and Motorbike Products (main_category)

2. Join Limitations:
   - Two-table joins support both INNER and LEFT JOIN
   - Three-table joins only support INNER JOIN
   - Join conditions are predefined based on category relationships

3. Best Practices:
   - Use meaningful table combinations
   - Add conditions after join specifications
   - Consider using limits for large joins
   - Group by category for statistical analysis
